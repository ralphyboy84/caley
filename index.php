        <p class="lead">On behalf of the Caledonia Golf Club and its members, it is my pleasure to welcome you to our club.
<br /><br />
Carnoustie has a reputation as a true test of golf, especially when the wind blows. All who come to play at Carnoustie marvel at its simple, but effective, design, which makes playing it such a pleasure. Whatever fate you suffer at the hands of the golfing gods, you are assured of some very memorable experiences.
<br /><br />
Our website provides visitors with the chance to find out more about the club's long history, plus the excellent services and facilities that we can offer guests to our clubhouse. With a special section on the characters who have graced the club down the years, the website also offers visitors a chance to learn about some of the special people who have contributed to the club's unique identity.
<br /><br />
We've also included a golfing events' section, so people planning a trip to Carnoustie can tie in their visit with a sporting occasion. To complement the events page, we've also provided information about society golf days and special price golf tickets that visitors to Carnoustie Links can buy.

Our clubhouse, which dates back well over 100 years, is the perfect place to unwind with 'a dram'. 
<br /><br />
We look forward to your visit. 
<br /><br />
