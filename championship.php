		<h2 class="featurette-heading">Championship Course</h2>
<hr class="featurette-divider">
        <p class="lead">
		We are both priviliged and proud in the Caledonia Golf Club, to play our golf over one of the finest courses in the world.<br /><br />
		<img class="featurette-image-course pull-right" src="aerial.jpg" alt="aerial" />
		The Championship Course in Carnoustie has hosted 6 Open Championships, most recently when Padraig Harrington won in 2007, plus countless other local and national tournaments.<br /><br />
		Measuring 6941 yards of the White tees, and stretching out to over 7400 yards for the Open Championship, the par 72 layout is said to be the toughest in Britain.<br /><br />		
		The course begins with a strong par 4 and one of the few blind shots on the course with an approach shot to a sunken green. <br /><br />
		The second is a picturesque hole set between the dunes down the right and left of the fairway. Beware with green on the 2nd as it measures 60 yards from front to back which could make a difference as many as 4 clubs in shot selection for the approach.<br /><br />
		The third, fourth and fifth holes are medium length par 4s where Jockeys Burn must be successfully avoided if par is to be gained.<br /><br />

		The par 5 6th is one of the finest holes in world golf. Named "Hogans Alley", Hogan made this hole famous in the 1953 Open when he decided to play down the left hand side between the OB fence and the bunkers. Standing on the 570 yard Championship tee, seeing just a slither of fairway you wonder what possessed him!<br /><br />
		Such was the great mans accuracy and consistency however, legend has it that in the final round (which in those days were both played on the Saturday) he ended up in his divot from the morning round.<br /><br />
		Even once the tee shot has been safely negotiated there is more trouble lurking with Jockeys Burn cutting into the middle of the fairway.<br /><br />
		The seventh is a medium length par 4, normally played into the wind, where the tee shot must avoid three strategically placed bunkers.<br /><br />
		The par 3 eigth is marked as SI 18 on the card, however the out of bounds fence is uncomfortably close to a slightly elevated green.<br /><br />
		On the par 4 tenth, the Barry Burn makes its first meaningful appearance of the round, winding its way round the front of the green.<br /><br />
		<img class="featurette-image-course pull-right" src="17.jpg" alt="specs" />
		The 11th hole heads back westerly before the par 5 12th hole offers the golfer a birdie chance before the fierce finish.<br /><br />
		Standing on the 14th tee marks the start of the hardest finish in Championship Golf.<br /><br />
		The famous spectacle bungers loom large in front of the 14th green, measuring about 10 feet in height. The 15th is no pushover either. Measuring over 450 yards, it is a slight dog left, with a left to right sloping fairway. Even with the tee shot successfully played, you are then left with arguably the hardest approach shot on the course.<br /><br />
		Jack Nicklause once called the par 3 16th the hardest par 3 in golf and it is easy to see why. At 245 yards to an elevated green it is a brute of a hole.<br /><br />
		17 and 18 have become infamous over the years for the meltdowns that have occurred in the Open Championship. Who can forget Romero making a triple in 2007, Harrington hitting it in the burn twice on 18, and thats not even mentioning a certain Frenchman!<br /><br />
		Successfully making your way through these two holes in par figures certainly deserves a celebratory drink in the clubhouse!
