Our historic clubhouse offers a wide range of facilities and quality services to members and guests. On the golfing side of things, club members have their own personal locker in the locker room, which also contains showers and toilets. The locker room and shower room is also made available for the use of visiting golfers. 
<br /><br />
We also have a full-size snooker table, which is very popular with the junior members of the club. To book a time on the table, just speak with the steward or stewardess. During the winter season (November to March), the club organises a snooker league, which is very popular with its members. 
<br /><br />
With the bay window seats in the clubhouse looking out on to the 18th green of the Championship Course, the lounge and dining area is a great place to go for a meal or a drink. Our bar manager and chef, Avril Barr and Mike Patteerson, can offer members and their guests an excellent choice of meals, snacks and buffets, at various times throughout the day. 
<br /><br />

The clubhouse bar is open seven days a week during the season (April to October), and is the perfect place to unwind after a competitive frame of snooker or following an eventful time out on the Links.
