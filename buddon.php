		The Buddon Course in Carnoustie is the youngest of our three courses.<br /><br />
		Purchases from land owned by the military at Barry Buddon, each hole takes on names of a famous historical battle.<br /><br />
		Although seen as the number three course in Carnoustie, much work has been done on the course over the last few years that has seen the Links been greatly improved.<br /><br />
		The greens in particular are equally as good as anything found on the Championship course and the par 4 7th is statistically the hardest hole in Carnoustie.<br /><br />
		Measuring at just over 400 yards, the 7th hole is lined by trees on both sides all the way down to the green.<br /><br />
		Does the golfer be aggresive off the tee with the driver and leave a short iron in, or play safe leaving a longer approach shot?<br /><br />
		In 2014 two new holes are scheduled to open on the Buddon.<br /><br />
		This will see the 9th and 10th hole merge to become a par 5 and will rid the course of the weak opening hole.<br /><br />
		With the two par 4s measuring over 400 yards, and water a factor in both of them, the new holes will continue to ensure that the Buddon is a challenge for even the strongest of player.
