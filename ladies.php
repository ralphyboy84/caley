WELCOME FROM THE LADY CAPTAIN
</p>
<p class="lead">
A warm welcome to the Ladies Section of the Caledonia Golf Club, Carnoustie.
</p>
<p class="lead">
Currently we have approximately 75 lady members with a broad mix of ages and handicaps.  Our normal competition day is Thursday when we run a full programme of fixtures including monthly medals, qualifying competition, inter-club matches, club competitions and fun events.  We also run 9 hole competitions for those who prefer not to play the full 18 holes.
</p>
<p class="lead">
The Ladies Section is represented on the Club Council by myself, the Vice-Captain and the Match Secretary.  We are always keen for more ladies to be part of the decision-making in the Club and if you feel you would like to become a member of the Club Council contact me.
</p>
<p class="lead">
We also have a Ladiesâ€™ Forum group who, whilst not part of the full Council, have an important role to play in making the views and opinions of all the Lady Members known to the Club Council.  
</p>
<p class="lead">
Various social events are organised throughout the year, apart from golfing events, which I hope you will support.  
</p>
<p class="lead">
We are always pleased to welcome and encourage new members, young and not so young, experienced golfers and those who are new to the game.  
</p>
<p class="lead">
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any further information on becoming a member of the Ladies Section of the Caledonia Golf Club.
</p>
<p class="lead">
Thank you for visiting our website.
</p>

Maureen Fyffe<br />
Lady Captain
