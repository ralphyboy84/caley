		The Burnside Course in Carnoustie is our second course.<br /><br />
		Whilst not as long as the Championship Course, it's tights fairways and small undulating greens more than make up for any lack of yardage.<br /><br />
		Used previously for Open Qualifying, the great Ben Hogan qualified over the Burnside Course on his way to winning in 1953, the Burnside has several holes that would not be out of place on its big brother.<br /><br />
		The par 3s are particularly strong on the Burnside and the par 4 17th is one of the hardest holes in Carnoustie. Players have to avoid the infamous Barry Burn with their tee shots as well as their approach shots into a small green.
