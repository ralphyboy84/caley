		The "Caley" has a reputation for being one of the friendliest golf clubs in Angus and visitors are always welcome to enjoy some refreshments in our spacious clubhouse.

		Carnoustie is a public course. This means that it is not owned by any one individual but in fact the people of Carnoustie. Because of this, there are several clubs in Carnoustie that play their golf over the world famous links.
		</p>
		<p class="lead">
		Essentially what this means, is that we here at the Caledonia Golf Club are unable to provide tee times or bookings for any of our 3 golf courses. That can be done <a href="http://www.carnoustiegolflinks.co.uk/visitors/online-booking/online-booking-payment-gateway-information" target="_blank">here</a> through the official website of Carnoustie Golf Links.
		</p>
		<p class="lead">
		What we can offer you instead however, is first class treatment before and after your round of golf at Carnoustie.
		</p>
		<p class="lead">
		If you would like anymore information on golf in Carnoustie, or the service we provide at the Caledonia Golf Club, please do not hesitate to contact the club using the <a href="contactus.php">Contact Us</a> form.
		</p>
		<p class="lead">
		We look forward to hearing from you and hope to see you soon!
