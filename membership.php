		Joining the club gives you several advantages. Firstly, you are able to play in competitions on all 3 courses every Saturday and Sunday, as well as one on the Buddon on a Wednesday and the Burnside on a Thursday in the summer.
		</p>
	  
		<p class="lead">
		Secondly, all members are given a 20 percent discount on prices at the bar, which is always useful when drowning your sorrows after a bogie on the last to miss the buffer by 1!
		</p>
		
		<p class="lead">
		And thirdly, joining the club also lets you represent the club in various matches over the course of the year. For the gents, we currently have club matches against Alyth Golf Club, Blairgowrie Golf Club, Forfar Golf Cub, Newmachar Golf Club and the Carnoustie Golf Club.

		The ladies also have matches against other clubs. This includes games against Forfar Ladies, Blairgowrie Ladies, Carnoustie Ladies and the St Regulus Club.
		</p>
		
		<p class="lead">
		We also have a thriving junior section. In 2013 our Juniors were taken for days out to Blairgowrie, Forfar and Glenisla with all expenses paid by the club. More of these events are planned for 2014. Plus the best bit is Junior membership is also free!
